Keyviz is a **free and open-source** tool that visualizes your keypresses and mouse actions in real-time. Let your audience know what handy shortcuts you're pressing during tutorials, presentations, collaborations, or whenever you need.


## ⌨️ Keypress & 🖱️ Mouse Actions
Along with normal keys, can also visualize mouse actions like <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Drag</kbd>, etc.

## ⚙️ Full Customization
Don't settle for defaults. Every aspect of the visualization is under your control:
- **Styling:** Change colors (modifier vs. regular keys), size, border radius, and icons.
- **Filtering:** Control which keys are shown using hotkeys or custom filters.
- **History:** Keep a visual trail of your recent inputs.
- **Position:** Move the visualization to any part of your screen.
- **Animations:** Customize how inputs appear and disappear with preset entry and exit animations.
